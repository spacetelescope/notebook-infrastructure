<h1>Our Notebook Philosophy</h1>
<p>STScI's mission is to make cutting-edge astronomy accessible to everyone. Creating open-source Jupyter Notebooks and making them available on GitHub maximizes accessibility and community engagement. </p>
<h2>Why Jupyter? Why Python?</h2>
<p>Jupyter Notebooks are, for the time being, one of the best resources for sharing narrated code. They allow us to demonstrate how our software works, explain how to reduce and analyze data from our missions, and help the community perform reproducible research.</p>
<p>Since most astronomers already use Python, that is the default language in our repository.</p>
