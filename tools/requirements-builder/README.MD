# About
This tool is intended for use with science platforms (e.g. TIKE). It attempts to find the most essential packages for an arbitrary collection of notebooks; we want the maximum number of passing notebooks for N included packages.

## Potential Improvements
- taking into account the structure in, e.g. JDAT notebooks where multiple nbs might share a single requirements file
- just generally having a programmer look at poorly-written astronomer code
